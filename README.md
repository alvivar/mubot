Bot that queues posts in **Twitter** and **Tumblr** with songs from **4chan** **mu** feedback threads!

**4chan** is a weird place sometimes, but I like a lot the music threads where everyone share their creations and feedback, lots of good stuff there. This bot aims to collect those songs and eventually help to promote or facilitate feedback.

* Includes links from SoundCloud and Bandcamp
* The tweet publishing is handled by **[Qbot](https://github.com/alvivar/qbot)**, this bot just collects the data into **qbot.json**
* You can use **'pyinstaller mubot.py --onefile'** to create a executable with **[pyinstaller](https://www.pyinstaller.org/)**
* **[ChomeDriver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/)** is used through Selenium to scrap the **JavaScript** dynamic stuff
