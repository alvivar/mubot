Bot that queues tweets using **[Qbot](https://github.com/alvivar/qbot)** with **SoundCloud** songs from **4chan** **mu** boards!

**4chan** is a weird place, but I like a lot the music threads where everyone share their creations and feedback. This bot aims to collect those songs and maybe help in that regard.

* You can use **'pyinstaller mubot.py --onefile'** to create a executable with **[pyinstaller](https://www.pyinstaller.org/)**
* **[ChomeDriver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/)** is used through Selenium to scrap the **JavaScript** dynamic stuff
