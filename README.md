# mubot

Bot that queues tweets using **[Qbot](https://github.com/alvivar/qbot)** about **SoundCloud** songs from **4chan** **mu** boards!

**4chan** is a weird place, but the mu community is kinda fun, I like a lot the SoundCloud threads where everyone share their music and feedback.

* You can use **'pyinstaller mubot.py --onefile'** to create a executable with **[pyinstaller](https://www.pyinstaller.org/)**
* **[ChomeDriver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/)** is used through Selenium to scrap the **JavaScript** stuff
