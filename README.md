Bot that queues tweets with **SoundCloud** songs from **4chan** **mu** feedback threads!

**4chan** is a weird place, but I like a lot the music threads where everyone share their creations and feedback. This bot aims to collect those songs and eventually help in that regard.

* The tweet publishing is handled by **[Qbot](https://github.com/alvivar/qbot)**, this bot just collects the data into **qbot.json**
* You can use **'pyinstaller mubot.py --onefile'** to create a executable with **[pyinstaller](https://www.pyinstaller.org/)**
* **[ChomeDriver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/)** is used through Selenium to scrap the **JavaScript** dynamic stuff
