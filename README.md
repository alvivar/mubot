Bot that queues songs from **4chan** **/mu** feedback threads (**soundcloud**, **bandcamp**) in **twitter** and **tumblr**!

**4chan** is a weird place, but I like a lot the music threads where everyone share their creations and feedback, lots of good stuff there. This bot aims to create a collection of those songs and help promote creators.

* The tweet publishing is handled by **[Qbot](https://github.com/alvivar/qbot)**, this bot just collects the data into **qbot.json**
* You can use **'pyinstaller mubot.py --onefile'** to create a executable with **[pyinstaller](https://www.pyinstaller.org/)**
* **[ChomeDriver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/)** is used through Selenium to scrap the **JavaScript** dynamic stuff
